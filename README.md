# Pub2Tools

Pub2Tools is a Java command-line tool that looks through the scientific literature available in [Europe PMC](https://europepmc.org/) and constructs entry candidates for the [bio.tools](https://bio.tools/) software registry from suitable publications. It automatises a lot of the process of growing bio.tools, though results of the tool still need some manual curation before they can be incorporated into bio.tools. Pub2Tools could be run at the beginning of each month to add tools, databases and services published in bioinformatics and life sciences journals during the previous month.

Documentation for Pub2Tools can be found at https://pub2tools.readthedocs.io/.
